> When $G$ has only one vertex, it is obviously connected with $0$ edges. Assume $G$ is connected with $k$ vertices $(k >= 1)$ and $k-1$ edges. When adding a new vertex $v$ to $G$, at least we need to add one edge between $u$ and $v$, where $u \in G$, to form a connected graph. Hence by mathematical induction, connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices has at least $n-1$ edges.

> If $c$ is a cut vertex, then the removal of it produces a subgraph $G'$ that is not connected. Assume after its removal there are $n$ connected components $G_1,\ G_2,\ \dots,\ G_n(n > 1)$. Taking two vertices $u, \ v$ ($u, v \ne c$) from $G_i$ and $G_j$($1 \leq i, \ j \leq n$). If there is a path between them withput passing through $c$, then they are connected, which contradicts they are not connected. Hence every path between $u$ and $v$ passes through $c$.
> If every path between $u$ and $v$ ($u, v \ne c$) passes through $c$, the the removal of $c$ results in that $u, \ v$ are no longer connected, in other words, they are in the different components. Hence the removal of $c$ produces at least two components, it is a cut vertex.

> Assume $f$ is an isomorphism form graph $G$ to $H$. If $G$ has a simple circuit of length $k$ $u_1, u_2, \dots, u_k$, then $f(u_1), f(u_2), \dots, f(u_k)$ is a simple circuit in $H$. Obviously it is a circuit since edges $u_1u_2, u_2u_3, \dots, u_{k}u_{1}$ in $G$ corresponding to edges $f(u_1)f(u_2), f(u_2)(u_3), \dots, f(u_{k})(u_{1})$. And there is no edge repeated in this circuit in $G$, hence there is no edge repeated in the corresponding circuit in $H$

> If the directed multigraph has an Euler circuit, then it is strongly connected (weakly connected as well) since the circuit allows us to travel from every vertex to any other vertices. By following the circuit,
